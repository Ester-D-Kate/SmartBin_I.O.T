The model is not mine Taken from the another repo link is givven in file WasteModelLink.txt

To run the server basic requirements are given but the python3.8 is required as model is trained on specific 
tensorflow and numpy version which runs smoothly on python3.8 only.

Also how to proceed is after installing python3.8 and making venv from it run:
"pip install -r requirement.txt"
and then run:
"pip install typing-extensions==4.13.1"  
as typing-extensions tensorflow uses is diff andd fastapi pydantic model uses is diff but we will prefer this one 
for this code
